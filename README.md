# My Dotfiles

Hello and welcome to my dotfiles. I hope you can use them for your system, but be warned that my workflow is quite weird.
For one I use the keyboard layout Dvorak and all the shortcuts are therefore for it optimised.
So if you're not a dvorak user, you should change the keybindings in Sway and NeoVim.

## Software I use

### Desktop
- Sway (Wayland Compositor)
- dmenu (Application Menu)

### Audio
- Pipewire
- Mocp (Music Player)

### Development
- st (Terminal Emulator)
- zsh (Shell)
- NeoVim (IDE)

### Miscellaneous

- mupdf (PDF viewer)

## Monitors
I have a dual monitor setup, which is configured in sway.

1. 144hz 3440x1440 Center
2. 60hz 1440x2560 Left (In pivot mode)

## Font

- [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) text with ligatures
- [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) icons

## NeoVim

I use NeoVim as my IDE with a few plugins. 

### Features
- Autocompletion for LaTeX, Golang, Rust
- Debugging for golang and rust
- Preview for LaTeX using mupdf and pdftex
- Custom theme
