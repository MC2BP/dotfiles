# My Dotfiles

Hello and welcome to my dotfiles. I hope you can use them for your own system, but be warned that my workflow is quite odd.
For one I use the Dvorak keyboard layout and all the shortcuts are therefore for optimised for it.
So if you're not a dvorak user, you should change the keybindings in Sway and NeoVim.

## Software I use
- Sway (Wayland Compositor)
- dmenu (Application Menu)
- moc (Music Player)
- st (Terminal Emulator)
- Zsh (Shell)
- Neovim (IDE)
- Firefox (Browser)
- mupdf (PDF viewer)

## Monitors
I have a dual monitor setup, which is configured in sway.

1. 3440x1440 144hz Center
2. 1440x2560 60hz Left (In pivot mode)

## Font

- [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) text with ligatures
- [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) icons

## Keyboard
To make my life a little easier, I edited the dvorak keyboard layout to more suit my needs.
For example have I remapped Capslock to Esc.
