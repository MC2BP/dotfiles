# My Dotfiles

Hello and welcome to my dotfiles. I hope you can use them for your own system, but be warned that my workflow is quite odd.
For one I use the Dvorak keyboard layout and all the shortcuts are therefore for optimised for it.
So if you're not a dvorak user, you should change the keybindings in Sway and NeoVim.

## Software I use
- Sway (Wayland Compositor)
- kickoff (Application Menu)
- mocp (Music Player)
- Foot (Foo Terminal)
- Zsh (Shell)
- Neovim / Neovide (IDE)
- Firefox (Browser)
- mupdf (PDF viewer)

*Other Software*
- greetd + tuigreet (Session Manager)
- Mako (Notification Center)
- xdg-desktop-portal + xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
- Pipewire (Audio)
- Swaylock (lockscreen)

## Monitors
I have a dual monitor setup, though mostly just use 1.

1. 3440x1440 144hz Left (main)
2. 3440x1440 60hz Right 

## Font

- [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) text with ligatures
- [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) icons

## Keyboard
To make my life a little easier, I edited the dvorak keyboard layout to more suit my needs.
For example have I remapped Capslock to Esc.
