# My Dotfiles

Hello and welcome to my dotfiles. I hope you can use them for your system, but be aware, that my system's configuration is quite odd.
I use a modified version of the dvorak layout and most shortcuts are with dvorak in mind. 
So if you're not a dvorak user, you should change the keybindings. 

## Software I use

### Desktop
- lightdm (Display Manager)
- lightdm-mini-greetr (greeter)
- i3wm (Window Manager)
- i3lock (Lock system)
- dmenu (Appilcation Menu)
- PolyBar (Status Bar)
- Flameshot (Snipping Tool)
- feh (Wallpaper)
- picom (transparency)

### Audio
- pulseaudio (Audio)
- spotifyD (Apotify Audio Client)
- spotify-tui (Spotify Interface)

### Development
- st (Terminal Emulator)
- zsh (Shell)
- vim (IDE)

## Monitors
I have a dual monitor setup. The configuration for them can be found in ```light/screen.sh```.

2. 60hz 1440x2560 Left (In pivot mode)

## Font

I use [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font with ligatures, which you will need to install manually.

## NeoVim

I use NeoVim as my IDE with a few plugins. 

### Features
